              <p>
                Corporate Collateral Transfer is a means of flexible financing
                where assets or existing loans or credit facilities are
                restricted and are unable to be used to extend or open new lines
                of credit. Collateral Transfer allows the borrower access to
                assets (collateral) to use as security for credit or loans.

                Bank Guarantees that are received under Collateral Transfer
                facilities can be used by beneficiaries to secure lines of
                credit at a bank. Typical lending rates (loan to value or LTV)
                will be around 80-90% of face value. A banker will usually have
                no objection to offering credit again Bank Guarantees received
                in this manner.
